# ECCOreproduce

We provide the detailed analysis scripts for ECCO here. 

Those analysis scripts require the R packages: data.table, peer, MatrixEQTL, doParallel and TwoSampleMR.

The R package TwoSampleMR could be installed through:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR")
```
And here is the detail information about the installation of R package peer:

We also provide the detailed analysis scripts for real data in the real data folder.

Data file is the pipeline about how we process the GTEx original data
